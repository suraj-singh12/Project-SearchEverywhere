A lot of information about recursive functions is also listed below.
A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.
Recursive functions are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller versions of the same problem.
1. A recursive function must have a base case.
2. A recursive function must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive function must call itself, recursively.
