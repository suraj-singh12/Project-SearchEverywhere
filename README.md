This is a tool that lists out all the lines containing `[keyword]` in the `[File(s)]` specified by user.

I have made this tool especially for college students so that they can easily find out the topics they wish to study from a number of ppts, pdfs and document files provided by their professors. However, in general, it can be used by anyone.

This is a powerful tool, as whenever you need to fetch a particular information from a file or a bunch of files, you can just give it a go and get exactly what you looking for without even opening any files.

This works well with ```.txt```(plain text files), ```.odt/.docx/.doc```(word documents), ```.odp/.pptx/.ppt```(presentations), ```.pdf```(pdf) file formats. A quick demo, showing working of this program is available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/suraj-singh-5092_connections-stackoverflow-project-activity-6816378849006374912-awv_)

## Analogy

If you are familiar with ```cat``` and ```grep``` tools and have at some point of time piped your output to ```grep``` command or done piping like ```cat syslog.log | grep ERROR``` or ```cat *.txt | grep "xyz information"``` then to tell you this program basically does similar type of work, under the hood. 

As ```cat``` only works on ```plain text``` files, and can't show you the text in ```.odp/.ppt/.pptx```(presentations), ```.odt/.doc/.docx```(word documents), ```.pdf``` files, this program does all this conversions in background to allow you to even peek in these files and get the information you are looking for.


## Difference
-> In a directory having ```plain text``` files, below both will work with same efficiency.

```bash
cat * | grep "information"
```

```bash
SearchEverywhere - "information"
```


-> But if the files are ```word documents```, ```pdfs```, ```presentations``` then:

```bash
cat * | grep "information"    # would NOT work
``` 

```bash
SearchEverywhere - "information"    # will still work
``` 
> The results are saved for later use in a `results.txt` file, so if in case user wants to use them, he/she may. But the file is overwritten every time a new search is performed.

> On files other than `.txt` type, conversions are done, and new directories are made. They can safely be removed after program terminates or can be utilised by user.

## Installation 
This works on almost all types of linux distros (i.e. debian-based, arch-based, redhat, fedora, etc) and can be installed by the following commands:

#### Clone the repo
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/suraj-singh12/Project-SearchEverywhere/
```
```bash  
cd Project-SearchEverywhere
```
```bash
sudo chmod +x ./dist/SearchEverywhere
```
#### Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo chmod +x dependency.sh
sudo ./dependency.sh
```
#### Install the tool
```bash
sudo sh install.sh
```

> `NOTE:` If you are installing the tool in `WSL`, ensure you also install the dependencies in `wsl_additional_requirements.txt` 

## Usage
To learn to use this easily, you may enter into ```testing_base``` directory, post installation of the tool.

```bash
cd testing_base
SearchEverywhere - heading    # will search 'heading' keyword in all files

SearchEverywhere -txt python  # will search 'python' keyword in all txt files
SearchEverywhere text_file.txt python # will search 'python' keyword in text_file.txt file

SearchEverywhere -odt "Final Purpose" # will search 'Final Purpose' keyword in all .odt file type files
SearchEverywhere mydocument2.odt "Final Purpose" # will search 'Final Purpose' keyword in mydocument.odt file

SearchEverywhere -odp "contains specific" # will search 'contains specific' keyword in all .odp files
SearchEverywhere mypresentation2.odp "contains specific" # will search 'contains specific' keyword in mypresentation.odp file

SearchEverywhere -pdf "member functions" # will search 'member functions' in all .pdf files
SearchEverywhere LectureNotes.pdf "member functions" # will search 'member functions' in LectureNotes.pdf files
```

#### List of all extensions supported:

`txt` `odp` `ppt` `pptx` `odt` `doc` `docx` `pdf`

An example video is given [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/suraj-singh-5092_connections-stackoverflow-project-activity-6816378849006374912-awv_), you may prefer to go through it incase you are facing any difficulty in learning this.

## Few Points
1. The search is case insensitive.
2. First time run on `.odp/.ppt/.pptx` files takes some time. The time taken is linear with the number of `.odp/.ppt/.pptx` files in the directory
