Hii all!!, this is the text file and a lot of text has been written into it.
Things are divided into lines
and lines are many
some lines contain words like python 
like c++ c java etc languages


cat * | grep keyword 
is also very helpful when you need to access information that is scattered in many files. 

well these are better alternatives:

grep ^ /dev/null * | grep keyword

grep "" *.txt
