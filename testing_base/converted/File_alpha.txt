Suppose this is a very crucial file,
you just remember some words from this very important file
and now you are searching for it, in your system everywhere, 
opening all the work folders and navigating without a clue, because you didn't even remember the file name
simply because you were too busy in your work or you just forgot the name now.
How would you find it? Let me tell you there's a better tool around the corner
use cat and pipe the output with grep. 
Ohh isn't it beautiful..? Yeah it is!
Here is my very crucial work "crucial word" 
Hey i need to have a relook at you ohh my file's crucial keyword
help me find this file.
A lot of information about recursive functions is also listed below.
Recursion: 
A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.
Recursive functions are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller versions of the same problem.
Properties: 
1. A recursive function must have a base case.
2. A recursive function must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive function must call itself, recursively.
